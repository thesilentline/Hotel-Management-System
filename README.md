# Hotel-Management-System
to show how the data/information in hotels is managed. This is just an overview of management in hotels. It manages and maintains the records of customers, rooms, employees and drivers in the hotel.

In this software I have tried to meet most of the requirements of the present hotel management system including maintaining details of customers, rooms, employees and drivers. I also keep provision to update the details of customers, rooms and employees. In my effort I have tried to make my software all the more user friendly but there may some features which I would like to include in my continuous attempts.
